first run prep.sh
then collate.sh

what I did last time:

print side1nup.pdf on 3 sheets
then put in the other side up, so that cover image is at top of printer

what happened:

second set of pages were wrong way round. printer prints 'upside down' so that the bottom of the page is closest to the print head after printing. I think it would be ok if both put in the same way.
